## Overview

The **Dashboard-Template** provides a user-friendly and customizable dashboard for managing your multitenant storefront. It is built using Next.js and TypeScript, which provide a powerful and scalable foundation for building modern web applications.

By utilizing the power of Next.js, you can benefit from server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and an optimized build process. TypeScript adds static typing to the project, enhancing its maintainability and reducing the chance of introducing bugs.

## Features

The Dashboard-Template offers the following features:

- **Store Management**: Easily manage multiple stores from a centralized dashboard.
- **Product Management**: Add, edit, and delete products for each store.
- **Order Management**: View and manage orders for each store.
- **Inventory Management**: Keep track of inventory levels and manage stock for each store.
- **User Management**: Manage user accounts and permissions for accessing the storefront.
- **Analytics and Reports**: View sales reports and analytics for each store.
